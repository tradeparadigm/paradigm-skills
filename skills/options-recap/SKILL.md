description: >
  Options market recap for a user-specified window, invoked via /recap. Parses
  "/recap [asset] [options] [window]" (e.g. "/recap btc options 8h") and produces
  a fixed-format recap with four sections: snapshot, biggest print, block flow,
  and vol surface. Use when the user types /recap or asks for a market recap,
  options flow summary, "what happened in BTC options", or "last Xh of flow".
  The output format is fixed — always the same four sections in the same order.
compatibility: Deribit public API (curl) for the 7d realized-vol closes only; Paradigm
  data (DuckDB+S3 via IRSA) for everything else — DVOL/spot, $ Volume, multi-venue
  activity/P-C, the vol surface, and the Biggest Print + Block Flow (the multi-venue
  paradigm_trade_tape_slim block tape). No authentication required for the public API;
  the S3 reads require the IRSA bootstrap (see paradigm-data-discovery skill).

# Options Recap

## Command Syntax

`/recap [asset] [options] [window]` — order-independent, all optional.

| Token | Examples | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `asset` | `btc`, `eth` | `btc` |
| `window` | any `Nm`/`Nh`/`Nd` up to 24h — `30m`, `3h`, `8h` (`1d`→`24h`) | `24h` |
| `options` | the literal word `options` | ignored — a no-op keyword (this skill is always options); `run_recap.sh` strips it |

Any `Nm`/`Nh`/`Nd` window up to 24h works and all render identically: DVOL/spot,
the `$` Volume line, and the multi-venue activity/P-C all come from one rolling hot
aggregates file sliced to the window at query time; the surface (and its Δ columns)
from `v_vol_surface`; and **Biggest Print + Block Flow from the multi-venue Paradigm
block tape** (`paradigm_trade_tape_slim`) — every venue Paradigm brokers
(Deribit/Paradex/Bullish/…), notional already in USD per leg — **plus venue-tape
blocks from the exchanges' own feeds** (any venue, off the hot recap file's
option `block` rows, deduped against the Paradigm tape by the venue's own block
id so nothing double-counts), which rank in the same pool and render as
`<Venue> Block` rows with a `(venue tape)` detail note. Biggest Print names its
venue as `via Paradigm/<venue>` (or `via venue tape`). The Paradigm tape has no
IV, so the top blocks' IV is looked up from the vol surface (Deribit legs only;
venue-tape blocks carry their venue's per-trade IV where published; other venues
show IV `n/a`). A malformed window exits with a clear error.

**Windows beyond 24h:** the Snapshot flow sources (the rolling hot aggregates file →
Volume/Activity/P-C/DVOL/spot) retain only ~24h, so `run_recap.sh` caps any longer
window (e.g. `2d`) at 24h and prepends a one-line `⚠ window capped at 24h — …` banner
as the first line of its output — **relay it verbatim** (don't drop or reword it).
Block Flow itself now comes from the months-deep block tape and isn't the constraint;
the cap lifts once the Snapshot sources are wired to the cold store.

**Vol-surface Δ coverage:** the window-open surface comes from `_hot.parquet`
(~2h rolling buffer) for short windows, else from the cold `v_vol_surface`
hour-partition at window-start (published ~15min after each hour closes; the
`_hot` fallback covers windows whose start hour isn't published yet). Δ columns
read `n/a` only when window-start is outside the available history — deeper than
the cold backfill, or in a partition gap.

`/recap` alone = BTC options, last 24h. Still pass just `<ASSET> <WINDOW>` to
`run_recap.sh` — it drops a stray `options`/`option` token, so `/recap btc
options 8h` and `/recap btc 8h` resolve identically.

## How to run it — pick the mode, then emit the four sections

**Live (real `/recap`, tools available) — this is the normal path.** Run ONE
command and relay its stdout **verbatim** as your entire reply:

```bash
bash scripts/run_recap.sh BTC 8h      # <ASSET> <WINDOW>; any Nm/Nh/Nd works; 1d→24h
```

That script does everything — STS bootstrap, the single DuckDB session (hot
surface + the Paradigm block tape), the Deribit 7d-closes fetch (the realized-vol
input), the vol math, and final formatting — and prints the finished four-section
recap. **Do not** add commentary, reformat it, re-fetch
anything, or run extra steps. Its output already is the recap. Your reply must
BEGIN with the script's first output line (the `⚠ …` banner when present, else
the bold header) — no preamble like "I'll run the recap", no trailing notes or
follow-up offers. If the script exits non-zero (e.g. `recap: bad window '5x'`),
**relay that error message verbatim and stop** — do not substitute a different
window, retry with defaults, or render a recap anyway. Target: well under 30s;
the heavy lifting is ~2.5s and the rest is just this one round-trip.

**Injected data (a `<market_data>` block with `derived` is in context).** No
tools — render the four sections yourself from `derived.realized_vol` (RV/VRP),
`derived.top_blocks` (Biggest Print + Block Flow), and `derived.vol_surface`
(skew/term + per-expiry ATM/RR/Fly, plus ΔATM/ΔRR/ΔFly when present — else `n/a`),
reading DVOL open/close and the spot range from the raw `dvol`/`spot` tape.
Follow the exact template in `references/output-format.md`. Report those figures
directly; do not recompute them and do not add a disclaimer.

**Simulate (no tools and no injected data).** Produce the four sections with
plausible example values following `references/output-format.md` exactly, and
prepend one line: `⚠ Data estimated — no live feed available.`

## Output Format

Four sections, this exact order, every recap: **Snapshot · Biggest Print ·
Block Flow · Vol Surface**. Never reorder, add, or drop sections. **Do not emit
Themes, Dealer positioning, or a Bottom Line.** Work silently — no narration.

In the live path `run_recap.sh` already prints exactly this shape, so you just
relay it. The full template, per-field formatting, the Vol Surface delta columns,
and the thin-window (`< 2h`) rules are the contract the script implements — see
`references/output-format.md`. Read it only when **you** render (the injected and
simulate modes); the live path never needs it.
