# Resolve an RFQ by `rfq_id` — Paradigm trade tape via data-discovery

The block analyst's input is `/analyze <rfq_id> <rfq description>`. The `rfq_id`
is the authoritative key. **Resolve it by searching the Paradigm trade tape
through the `paradigm-data-discovery` skill** — that skill owns the S3 catalog,
the credentials, and the DuckDB query path. This file is the recipe for turning
the `rfq_id` into the full trade record the analysis needs (the same fields that
used to be pasted as JSON).

## How to resolve it

### 1. Query the Paradigm trade tape via `paradigm-data-discovery` (primary)

Hand the `rfq_id` to the `paradigm-data-discovery` skill and have it query the
executed-block tape, filtered to that id. The dataset is
`paradigm_trade_tape_slim` (executed RFQ block trades), keyed by `RFQ_ID`:

```sql
-- credential bootstrap + httpfs per paradigm-data-discovery (S3 via IRSA)
INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;

SELECT DATE, TIME, AUCTION, PRODUCT, DESCRIPTION, QTY, PRICE, REF_PRICE,
       SIDE, QUOTE_CURRENCY, NOTIONAL_VOLUME_USD, RFQ_ID, TRADE_ID, BLOCK_TRADE_ID
FROM read_csv_auto('s3://dt-paradigm-data/paradigm_data/paradigm_trade_tape_slim.csv.gz')
-- rfq_id may arrive bare (r_...) or prefixed (DRFQv2-r_...); match either form
WHERE RFQ_ID = '<rfq_id>'
   OR RFQ_ID = 'DRFQv2-' || '<rfq_id>'
   OR RFQ_ID LIKE '%' || regexp_replace('<rfq_id>', '^DRFQv2-', '');
```

> **The tape prefixes ids with a routing tag (e.g. `DRFQv2-`). Strip/ignore the
> prefix when matching — the `r_…` core is the stable key. Never conclude "not on
> tape" from an exact-match miss; retry with the suffix match above before failing.**

`paradigm-data-discovery` owns the canonical bucket/path and credentials — defer
to its `references/datasets.md` for the current S3 URI (it has moved before)
rather than hard-coding it here.

Notes:
- A whole structure sits on the matched row(s) — `DESCRIPTION` encodes the full
  strategy (e.g. `Straddle 19 Nov 25 3050`, `RRCall 30 Jan 26 70000/108000`,
  `Cstm +1.00 Call 24 Apr 26 78000 -2.00 Call 24 Apr 26 85000`). Rows sharing a
  `BLOCK_TRADE_ID` are one block — keep them together.
- The tape is the **executed** tape. For RFQ-level context (fill rate, unfilled,
  lifespan) the sibling dataset is `paradigm_rfq_tape_slim` (same `RFQ_ID` key).
- **Auth:** S3 reads need IRSA credentials — handled by `paradigm-data-discovery`
  (see its `references/s3-access.md`). This is **not** chat-pasted; if the
  credentials / DuckDB tool are unavailable, fall back below.

**Self-test (regression guard — bare id must resolve a prefixed row):** given a
tape row whose `RFQ_ID` is `DRFQv2-r_01H8XQ…`, the canonical query above invoked
with the **bare** id `r_01H8XQ…` must return that row (via the `'DRFQv2-' || …`
and `LIKE '%' || …` arms). If a bare-id lookup comes back empty on a tape known
to carry the prefixed form, the prefix handling has regressed — fix the match
before reporting "not on tape".

### 2. Fallbacks (when the tape can't be queried)

| Source | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| Injected block-trade context | running inside the Dime/terminal session | the terminal attaches the cleared block (e.g. a `set_block_trade_context` feed) — read it directly |
| Deribit public tape | last resort, no Paradigm tape access | reconstruct the block from `block_trade_id` clusters (SKILL Step 3b) |

**If the id cannot be resolved on any source, do NOT fabricate the record.**
Fall back to the inline `<rfq description>` for the structure, fetch live marks
per the normal flow, and **state plainly that the RFQ could not be resolved** so
the fill price / mark offset read as *unavailable* rather than invented. See the
SKILL.md output rules for the failure-mode line.

## Field mapping — trade-tape row → analysis fields

`paradigm_trade_tape_slim` carries the information that used to arrive as pasted
JSON. Map by the tape's actual columns:

| Analysis field (SKILL Step 1) | Trade-tape column |
|---|---|
| `description` / legs | `DESCRIPTION` (structure name + expiry + strikes; parse per the examples above) |
| `action` / taker side | `SIDE` (`BUY` / `SELL`) |
| `quantity` | `QTY` (contracts) |
| `price` (fill) | `PRICE` (execution price, in `QUOTE_CURRENCY`) |
| `mark_price` | `REF_PRICE` (reference/mark at trade time) |
| `displayValues.markOffset` | computed: `PRICE − REF_PRICE` |
| `venue` | from `PRODUCT` suffix — `DBT` Deribit, `PRDX` Paradex, `BYB` Bybit |
| `product_codes` / asset + kind | from `PRODUCT` — e.g. `BTC OPTION - DBT`, `ETH PERPETUAL - DBT`, `BTC OPTION - PRDX` |
| `quote_currency` | `QUOTE_CURRENCY` (`BTC` / `ETH` / `USD` …) |
| USD notional | `NOTIONAL_VOLUME_USD` |
| `rfqType` (`RFQ`/`OB`) | `AUCTION` |
| ids | `RFQ_ID`, `TRADE_ID`, `BLOCK_TRADE_ID` |

**Not in the tape — pull live or infer (never fabricate):**
- `index_price` / **spot**: not a tape column — pull the live underlying
  (`BTC-PERPETUAL` / `ETH-PERPETUAL`) mark in Step 2, or use the description.
- `strategy_code`: not stored — infer the structure from `DESCRIPTION`
  (see `references/strategy-codes.md`).
- per-leg greeks/IV: not in the tape — fetched live in Step 2 (or via Bullish
  chain snapshots / exchange market data through `paradigm-data-discovery` for historical).

## The role of the inline `<rfq description>`

The `<rfq description>` after the `rfq_id` is a **human-readable hint**, not the
source of truth:

- **Cross-check** — confirm the resolved row matches what the user expects
  (right structure, strikes, expiry). If the tape row and the description
  disagree materially, surface that the `rfq_id` resolved to a *different* trade
  rather than silently overriding.
- **Disambiguation** — if more than one row comes back, use the description to
  pick the right block.
- **Fallback** — if the tape can't be queried, parse the structure from the
  description so the greeks/fair/live brackets can still be produced from live
  data, with the fill-vs-mark line marked unavailable.

The resolved tape row always wins for numeric fields (fill price, mark,
quantity). The description never overrides a retrieved number.
